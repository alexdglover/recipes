# Neapolitan style pizza crust

## Ingredients

* 660 grams of bread flour<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
* 400 grams (or milliliters) of water
* 10 grams of active yeast
* 13 grams of salt
* 2 tablespoons of olive oil

## Directions

1. Combine flour with yeast
  a. This can be done directly in your stand mixer bowl
1. Heat water to approximately 120°F/49°C
  a. If you don't have a thermometer, I microwave the water for 1m10s
1. Add water and oil to flour-yeast mixture
1. Mix ingredients with a stand mixer on speed 2 for 7 minutes
  a. Dough will come together in a ball. Dough should be tacky to the touch, but dry enough to handle
1. Add salt to dough. Mix for another 7 minutes
1. Coat a large mixing bowl with olive oil. Transfer dough to mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap
  a. Do not use a towel or other material besides plastic wrap, as the dough will dry out
1. Place dough in refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
  a. This is the cold fermentation step and will add a flavor to the dough
1. Cut dough into two even portions. Round the dough into balls, tucking any rough edges into the bottom
1. Allow the dough to proof at room temperature for 5 hours<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
1. Place any dough you want to keep in the refrigerator or freezer
1. Preheat your oven to 525°F. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven before preheating.
1. Roll out the dough. Place semolina flour down on a work surface. Start by using your fingers to push the
middle of the dough down, making sure not to crush the outer edge of the dough. Push and stretch the dough
until big enough that you can use your full hand and palms to stretch the dough out. The dough should easily
stretch out to a 12" circle.
  a. This dough will grow significantly in the oven. Don't squeeze all the air out of the edge, but don't leave
     the edge too large either. Try to get the inner dough as thin as possible, to give the pizza a crunch
  b. This dough is very resilient. While not the best technique, you can definitely use a rolling pin on this dough
     to get the dough down to 4-5mm, then hand toss the dough from there
1. Place semolina flour or cornmeal on your [pizza peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_(tool)). Transfer your
dough to the peel. Put your sauce on the pizza.
1. Bake the dough and sauce for 10 minutes.
1. Take the pizza out. Add cheese and toppings to the pizza.
1. Bake for another 3-5 minutes until cheese is golden. 


## Footnotes

##### 1

This recipe works with normal flour as well, but won't need as much proofing time. Recipe works well
with mixtures of flour as well, including 00 flour and semolina flour.

##### 2

Proofing will give the dough volume, but also add slack to the dough, making it easier to work with.
You can proof the bread for less time, but it may be harder to work with. If you're using a flour with
less gluten content (like normal flour), try proofing the bread for only 3 hours so the dough isn't
*too* slack.
